# Introduction to Machine Learning

Assigments folder contains implementation of main machine learning algorithms by using numpy, scipy... libraries. The course was perfect. I have access to almost anything. And there were given answers to check whether you did assigment correctly.

Competitions still not finished. If I could make myself, I will do them. 


I had some knowledge of probability and statistics before course. While following lecture, I had realized that I don't have linear algebra knowledge. While bouncing around, I had come across this [legendary course from Gilbert Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/). He is legendary that at 85 he is still giving course with such rigor and full of passion. If you have some basic knowledge on linear algebra and want to learn more, I think, this is the thing you should follow.
